Starting sometime next week, I will be starting a new project at 8D Technologies, where I am currently interning. I have completed my suppose to be 4 months project on the QA automation testing framework/toolkit in 2 months.

Today my team lead approached me, and offered me to work on a new project. This new project will be consisting of writing plugins (internal) for the Redmine platform (if you are doing software, then you should have heard of Redmine). I am **very** excited. The reason is because I always wanted to work on a real Ruby projects, and I believe this opportunity will allow me to practice what I have learned and to improve my Ruby skills.

That said, I will still provide support for the test automation tool. These tasks consist of providing more internal API for compatibility with Selenium WebDriver, bug fixings, and *possibly* write a Firefox plugin that would go hand-in-hand with the existing Selenium IDE, which would help QA teams to easier exporting their test cases and test suites from the IDE into WebDriver code.

Yay!
