Today I have learned from the hard way to always keep a data backup of your server. I was cleaning a miscellaneous folder that was named `~` in order to upload my latest `git subtree` post. Without even thinking twice, I typed in `rm -rf ~` and wipe completely my home folder.

On a bright side however, I owe my website a good cleanup, so I will take this opportunity to build new content in the up coming few days toward the end of my internship.
