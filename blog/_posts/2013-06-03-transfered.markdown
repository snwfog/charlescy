Starting from today, I am officially transferred away from the QA team to the development team at 8D Technologies. My work is still consist of the same as before; to build an automatic tool for the QA team for system testing, and setup a series of technologies and tools for continuous integration. However, I will have now a supervisor directly from the server and development team, which would look after my work and my progress.

Yay!
