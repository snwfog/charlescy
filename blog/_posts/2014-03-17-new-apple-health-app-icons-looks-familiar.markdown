Two years ago I worked as a developer/ui/ux designer for a closed source Android app during my summer as a research assistant. The app in question is called “Vital Sign” and would help doctors and nurses to monitor patient vitals with the aid of a portal device. I based my design mostly on Window flat retro design at the time. Today, I was reading through my daily Apple news and saw that Apple released their own version of health app. And strangely, they are using a few icon designs that are very similar to mine. See it for yourself, the three in questions are _vitals_, _blood pressure_, and _oxygen_.

That leaves me with only one question in mind, can I ask Apple for royalties on the icon design?
