    <p>Haven’t been updating the blog for a while. I guess this update is a well deserving one.</p>

<p>First, I finally graduated with a bachelor of Software Engineering from Concordia University in Montreal. People sometime ask why I choose to go to Concordia University whereas I could have go back to McGill; well there are two reasons. In my opinion, Concordia had a much bigger focus on hands-on experience, and encourages students to participate in internships and coops. The coops and the industrial experience program at Concordia are example of such emphasis. Whereas at McGill, I do not remember to have such a program, except the honor programs in every faculty. Second of all, I move relatively close to Concordia during my last year at McGill, then choosing Concordia was a no-brainer, considered that I did not want to walk myself all the way across campus and to Trottier building in the cold Montreal winter. I greatly enjoyed my time at Concordia, much more than I did back at McGill. I am extremely happy about been graduated, for one, it’s about damn time; for two, I am extremely grateful that I am doing something I love and that I am passionate about. I love to talk about my job, and to talk about what I do currently in my career. I code at work, I code after work, and I go to sleep thinking about how to resolve problems better; not every job on earth is this motivating; and to me, coding is definitely one of them.</p>

<p>That brings me to talk about what I do after work. I am currently working in parallel on two projects. The first one is a Node.js + Phaser.io + HTML5 + multiplayer game that me and my friend we are developing weekly. I coined the name Trill, as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trill_(music)">playing the piano</a>. The idea of the game is simple, tap your keyboard as fast as possible to measure your clicks per minute in a tug-of-war style against your friend(s). I think the action of tapping on the keyboard looks a lot from playing a trill on a piano. We also sometime call it “the <em>stupid</em> game”, just cause we want to have fun building it and refering it when we talk about it. We are keeping it private for now until we are able to run some alpha test amongst friends.</p>

<p>The second project is a personal project, but its idea comes from my current work. I am porting my work application from Java to Rails. Our work application front end is a SPA using Angular.js that is API driven, so it will be easy to test my backend with the SPA.</p>

<p>I do believe that the look of my blog and my website is getting old, I have the intention of revamping my current blog theme with a minimalistic flat design, and upgrade to the latest Octopress. It’s a smaller project, but one that I am definitely planning to complete by the end of summer. I am looking for something simpler.</p>

<p>Work wise, I intend to complete my current internship at CloudOps. CloudOps is a Montreal based startup company located in the charming Griffin Town. I love the company; its atmosphere, and its people are attractive. At the end of my internship, I will be moving to Toronto to join Oracle, and I am excited. Moving to Toronto in mid-September will leave me with a month of free time where I can catch up on my C# skill, and I have also planned a solo-hiking trip as well. I plan to hike from Montreal to Vancouver, and then once I reach Vancouver (if I ever reach there), I will probably buy a flight ticket from Vancouver to China. I will be keeping my itinerary up to date mostly on Instagram when I start the journey around mid-August. Sur ce, a-la prochaine!</p>
