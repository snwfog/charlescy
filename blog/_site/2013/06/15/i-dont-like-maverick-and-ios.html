    <p>There I said it.</p>

<p>I have been waiting patiently for this year’s WWDC keynote, and I was disappointed with the new overhaul interface for both Mac OS, and iOS. Prior to the keynote, I saw a few leaked screenshots for the iOS, and I sincerely prayed that they were fake and that the new iOS interface is going to be awesome. Sadly, those leaked screenshots were legit. I don’t understand why there were so many hates toward skeumorph in user interfaces. In my opinion, they add depth to otherwise a flat screen, and they are pleasing to the eye. It takes skills to design and to develop skeumorphic interface, and it shows that a lot of artistic values were added into the process. If I wanted a flat UI, I would be using a Windows phone long time ago (and I quite like Windows phones UI/UX).</p>

<p>The new calendar on Mac OS X is basically removed the “leather” skin, throw in Helvetica, and add a map functionality (which has been missing for far too long). Besides that, a lot of change for the “new” Mavericks, are just under the hood. And frankly (this is another rant), I am kind of getting tired of Apple releasing small OS upgrades, which compares to Windows, could just be some service packs. Except for Windows, they are free. And I will dream that Mavericks will be free as well (most likely it will be a one time 20$, similar to the last two “operating systems” upgrade from Apple).</p>

<p>I love Macs, and I love iPhones. But I am extremely disappointed by the new design direction from Apple for their products.</p>
