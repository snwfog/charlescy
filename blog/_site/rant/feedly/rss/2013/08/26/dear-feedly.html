    <p>When Google Reader announced its retirement, I quickly sought after a free, and a viable alternative. Feedly, you seemed to be a good fit. You have a clean, and almost Google Reader like interface. You also run great within my Google Chrome browser; saving me the memory of spawning a new application. You lacked of some important features, one of them obviously is searching. But overall, I enjoy using you as my main daily RSS reader, despite your flaws.</p>

<p>But Feedly, let me tell you something that upset me is as an user: charging for a “pro” account. You did not mention that you where going to charge for “pro” only features when everyone was looking for a Google Reader alternative. Because frankly Feedly, I thought you will forever threat all of your users the same way just like Google Reader did. Honestly, I think an RSS reader should have a search function by default. This is why I choose Google Reader the first place, because its easy to use, and its <strong>free</strong>, free as no payment for a <em>pro</em> account.</p>

<p>A daily Feedly user,</p>
