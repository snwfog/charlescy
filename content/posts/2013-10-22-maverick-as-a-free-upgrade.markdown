Seems like Apple had the same feeling regarding my little rant about $20 for small OS updates (such in the case of Lion and Mountain Lion), so today they have announced OS Mavericks as a free upgrade for everyone. And apparently, you could update to Maverick for free whether you are still on Leopard, or Lion.

Nice move Apple.

I will probably have a more complete thought about today's event in a later post if I have got time later.
