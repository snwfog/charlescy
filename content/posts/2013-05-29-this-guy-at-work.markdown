I started my internship about a month ago. I worked in a room with another coworker. This coworker is the coolest coworker that I've ever encountered. The company work hours are flexible, but usually you have to be there before 9 am. He comes to work around 10 am, but he __always__ leaves after me. He is the kind of guy that you could say whatever you want to to him and he will be cool about it, really, he does. You can talk with him freely about the company, and its environment freely, without have the worries of been whistleblowed.

As a new employee, he doesn't treat me like one at all. He does not look over my shoulder to make sure that I was doing my work. He does not check when I come and go in the office, or whatever how long I have spend in the toilette (just joking). He just minds his own business while I does mine. 

He is leaving for New Zealand this week. He actually lived there for a year, and came back to Montreal for a month. AS requested by the CEO of the company, he agreed to stay in Montreal for an extra month to work at the head office. From Monday next week, he will be restored into his daily duty but on the other side of the globe. While my function at the work rarely requires me to talk with him, and him to me, I quickly unconsciously felt and accepted him as a good friend of mine. I think it will feel extremely weird that he will be on the other side of the globe on Monday, when I will come to the office as usual, and he will not be there, as he will now start a new life that will totally be the opposite of mine.

Good luck buddy!
